Class-based subnetting architecture dividing addresses into three different classes:

**Class A** - 8 bits for network, 24 bits for host
- Subnet mask: 255.0.0.0
- First octet: 0-127
**Class B** - 16 bits for network, 16 bits for host
- Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0
- First octet: 128-191
**Class C** - 24 bits for network, 8 bits for host
- Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
- First octet: 192-223

Classful subnetting is not formally used but used as a starting point and in conversation,

Class D (multicast)
Class E (reserved)

Parts of a subnet
- Network address (first IP address of the subnet)
- First usable host address (one higher than network address)
- Network broadcast address (last IP address of the subnet)
- Last usable host address (one lower than network broadcast address)

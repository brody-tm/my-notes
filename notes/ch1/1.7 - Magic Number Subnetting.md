**Magic number subnetting** is a shortcut technique used in IP subnetting to **quickly determine subnet ranges and broadcast addresses** without converting between binary and decimal repeatedly. Itâ€™s especially useful for **Class C** networks, but it can apply to any class.

### When to Use It

Use magic number subnetting when:

- You're given a subnet mask like `/26`, `/27`, etc.
    
- You want to quickly list **subnet ranges**, **valid host ranges**, and **broadcast addresses**.

### Magic number = 256 - interesting octet

### The magic number is the size of each subnet block, including:

- 1 **network address** (aka subnet ID)
    
- **Usable host addresses**
    
- 1 **broadcast address**

### Ports
Every open port is a possible entry point. To mitigate risk, disable unnecessary ports and services

We can control access to ports with a firewall (new gen firewall)

### Default Credentials
Change the default credentials for devices - these are often public info and provide full control over a device

### Port Security
Features built in to switches that prevent unauthorized users from connecting to a switch interface

Based on source MAC address - we can configure how many MAC addresses can be associated with an interface - if this is exceeded, port security activates and may disable the interface

### Disabling Unused Switch Interfaces
Best practice - takes more time and effort, but more secure

We can require authentication to connect to any interface on a switch. This is referred to as **Network Access Control (NAC)**, often implemented as 802.1X

### MAC Filtering
Used to limit access to devices based on their hardware address

MAC addresses can be spoofed to bypass this - an attacker may scan a network to discover a working MAC address to spoof

### Key Management System
Centralized management consoles for keys and certificates of specific or various different services or cloud providers

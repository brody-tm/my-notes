**Precautions**
Always disconnect devices
Some devices store charge in a capacitor
Never connect yourself to a ground wire

**Units**
Amp - The rate of electron flow past a point in one second
- "The diameter of the hose"

Volt - Electrical "pressure" pushing the electrons
- "How open the faucet is"

Watt - Measures electrical load - "How much energy is being consumed?"
- Watts = Volts * Amps

**Current**
Alternating current (AC)
- Direction constantly reverses
- Distributes electricity efficiently over long distances
- Frequency is important 
	- 110-120 V of AC (VAC) at 60 Hz in NA
	- 220-240 VAC at 50 Hz in EU
Direct current (DC)
- Current moves in one direction with constant voltage

**Power Supplies**
- Devices commonly use DC that is converted to AC by the power supply

**UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply)**
- Short-term backup power
- Blackouts, brownouts, surges
- Common types:
	- Offline/standby (turns on upon blackout)
	- Line-interactive (senses voltage drop and increases power)
	- On-line/double conversion (always running from batteries that are charged by power source)

**PDU (Power Distribution Unit)**
- Rack devices with multiple outlets that include remote monitoring and control

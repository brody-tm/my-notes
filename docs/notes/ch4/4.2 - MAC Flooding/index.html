<p><em>Reminder:</em> MAC addresses are 48 bits / 6 bytes</p>
<p>The first half of a MAC address is called the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)</p>
<ul>
<li>the manufacturer</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter half of a MAC address is called the Network Interface Controller-Specific</p>
<ul>
<li>the serial number</li>
<li>&quot;burned in address&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Table in the switch keeps track of MAC addresses and which interfaces they are associated with</p>
<ul>
<li>Entries in this table are typically cached and age out periodically</li>
</ul>
<p>MAC address table creation</p>
<ul>
<li>All inbound MAC addresses are recorded if not already in the table
<ul>
<li>The interface over which the traffic was received is recorded as the &quot;output interface&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any traffic of which the destination MAC is not know persists as &quot;inbound&quot; traffic</li>
</ul>

<p>MAC addresses tables are <em>central</em> to the switching process</p>
<hr>
<h3>Mac Flooding</h3>
<p>The MAC address table begins to fill up as more devices send traffic over a switch. Once it does fill up, all traffic will be automatically forwarded to every interface on the switch.</p>
<ul>
<li>This allows an attacker to see all traffic being sent over a switch</li>
<li>Modern switches' port security setting allow MAC flooding to be restricted</li>
</ul>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS) - Forcing a service to fail</p>
<ul>
<li>Overloading the service, exploiting a design failure or vulnerability</li>
<li>Important to keep systems up to date</li>
<li>Sometimes, a DoS is a distraction for another attack</li>
</ul>
<p>Friendly DoS - When it's your fault</p>
<p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) - when many devices are deployed to bring down a service</p>
<ul>
<li>Botnets with thousands or millions of servers</li>
<li>Asymmetric threat - when the attack has fewer resources than the victim</li>
</ul>
<p>DDoS Reflection and Amplification</p>
<ul>
<li>Attacker sends a small amount of traffic that is amplified by various systems and protocols</li>
<li>NTP, DNS, and ICMP can be abused to amplify traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>Botnet Command and Control (C&amp;C) - device that manages the process of a DDoS attacker</p>

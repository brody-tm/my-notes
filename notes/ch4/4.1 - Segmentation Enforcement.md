Segmentation can be done physically, logically, or virtually
- Devices, VLANs, virtual networks

Segmentation is done for various reasons
- Performance - high bandwidth apps
- Security - users should not talk to database servers
- Compliance - payment card industry compliance, etc.

IoT devices may not have advanced security features, so they should be put on a separate network

IIoT (Industrial IoT) devices also should be segmented) to prevent disruptions from other traffic, as they are often in critical applications (medical, manufacturing

SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System) and ICS (Industrial Control Systems) are used to control equipment used in power generation, manufacturing, and more
- They often involve real time information and critical systems control
- **SCADA and ICS are heavily segmented**

Operational Technology (OT)
- Hardware and software for electrical grids, traffic lights, sewage plant, etc.
- Results of failure are wide reaching, segmentation critical

Guest networks - allow guests to use your router to access the internet but not any of the devices on the network

BYOD - Bring your own device
- Device is segmented - separate area on your device created for company data

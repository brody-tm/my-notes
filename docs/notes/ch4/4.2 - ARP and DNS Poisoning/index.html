<p>Spoofing - pretending to be something you're not</p>
<p>ARP - For when a device needs to communicate with another IP on the same network</p>
<ul>
<li>The device broadcasts a request asking &quot;whose MAC address is associated with this IP?&quot;</li>
<li>The device with that IP will send a response back containing its MAC address</li>
<li>The original device will cache the IP and MAC address together in its <em>ARP Cache</em></li>
</ul>
<p>ARP Poisoning / IP Spoofing - impersonating another device on a network</p>
<ul>
<li>ARP does not have security built in</li>
<li>A malicious device sends an unsolicited ARP response
<ul>
<li>ARP is stateless, so a device does not remember if it has sent an ARP request</li>
<li>Therefore, any time it receives an ARP response, it interprets it as usual</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The malicious device says that ITS MAC address is associated with the IP of, say, a router</li>
<li>The victim device will update its ARP cache, associating the IP address of the router with the MAC address of a malicious device</li>
<li>The malicious device will commonly forward traffic sent to it to the router such that neither the victim nor router know about it</li>
</ul>
<p>DNS Poisoning - impersonating another website</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be done by modifying a DNS server or the responses it sends
<ul>
<li>Changing the IP address for a domain inside a DNS server</li>
<li>Modifying DNS responses as they are being sent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can also be done by modifying a machine's <code>hosts</code> file
<ul>
<li>A file that associates domain names with IP addresses and has a higher priority than DNS responses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Routers handle the process of creating routes dynamically and update each other</p>
<p>All routers know where a knew route is added or one is removed</p>
<p>Router B may send an update to Router A with additional routes. Router A will update its routing table such that one of the new destinations in the update may now be reached by first sending packets to router B.</p>
<p>Different routing protocols use different criteria for determining the best route to take</p>

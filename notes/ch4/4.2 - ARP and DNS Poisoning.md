Spoofing - pretending to be something you're not

ARP - For when a device needs to communicate with another IP on the same network
- The device broadcasts a request asking "whose MAC address is associated with this IP?"
- The device with that IP will send a response back containing its MAC address
- The original device will cache the IP and MAC address together in its *ARP Cache*

ARP Poisoning / IP Spoofing - impersonating another device on a network
- ARP does not have security built in
- A malicious device sends an unsolicited ARP response
	- ARP is stateless, so a device does not remember if it has sent an ARP request
	- Therefore, any time it receives an ARP response, it interprets it as usual
- The malicious device says that ITS MAC address is associated with the IP of, say, a router
- The victim device will update its ARP cache, associating the IP address of the router with the MAC address of a malicious device
- The malicious device will commonly forward traffic sent to it to the router such that neither the victim nor router know about it

DNS Poisoning - impersonating another website
- Can be done by modifying a DNS server or the responses it sends
	- Changing the IP address for a domain inside a DNS server
	- Modifying DNS responses as they are being sent
- Can also be done by modifying a machine's `hosts` file
	- A file that associates domain names with IP addresses and has a higher priority than DNS responses

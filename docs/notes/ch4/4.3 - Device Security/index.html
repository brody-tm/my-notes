<h3>Ports</h3>
<p>Every open port is a possible entry point. To mitigate risk, disable unnecessary ports and services</p>
<p>We can control access to ports with a firewall (new gen firewall)</p>
<h3>Default Credentials</h3>
<p>Change the default credentials for devices - these are often public info and provide full control over a device</p>
<h3>Port Security</h3>
<p>Features built in to switches that prevent unauthorized users from connecting to a switch interface</p>
<p>Based on source MAC address - we can configure how many MAC addresses can be associated with an interface - if this is exceeded, port security activates and may disable the interface</p>
<h3>Disabling Unused Switch Interfaces</h3>
<p>Best practice - takes more time and effort, but more secure</p>
<p>We can require authentication to connect to any interface on a switch. This is referred to as <strong>Network Access Control (NAC)</strong>, often implemented as 802.1X</p>
<h3>MAC Filtering</h3>
<p>Used to limit access to devices based on their hardware address</p>
<p>MAC addresses can be spoofed to bypass this - an attacker may scan a network to discover a working MAC address to spoof</p>
<h3>Key Management System</h3>
<p>Centralized management consoles for keys and certificates of specific or various different services or cloud providers</p>
<p>SSH keys, TLS/SSL Certificates, Reports</p>

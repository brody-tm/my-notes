<p>BOOTP / Bootstrap - The 1993 precursor to DHCP</p>
<p>DHCP provides automatic IP address configuration and other configuration for most devices.</p>
<h3>DHCP Process</h3>
<p>D - Discover - Requesting device sends a DHCP discover packet over broadcast
O - Offer - DHCP server sees discover packet and sends an offer over broadcast
R - Request - Requesting device picks an IP and sends a request for it over broadcast
A - Acknowledgement - DHCP server sends an acknowledgement</p>
<p>In this process, the requesting device uses udp/68 and the DCHP server uses udp/67</p>
<p>Because broadcasts only happen within a subnet, DHCP does not work across subnets. Luckily, we have a way to do this: DHCP Relays</p>
<p>DHCP Relay - Forwards a discover packet to a subnet with a DHCP server</p>
<p>Gem - The subnet mask tells the device which IP address it can communicate with directly and which it needs to send to the local gateway IP.</p>

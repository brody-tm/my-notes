<p>We need to monitor our network devices to react to events, such as account access, redundant devices, and bandwidths.</p>
<p>Oftentimes device logs are aggregated into a status dashboard, where we can get the status of all systems at a glance.</p>
<p>NetFlow - Gathers summaries of statistics about the flow of traffic on a network</p>
<ul>
<li>Probe - Sits somewhere on a network to watch traffic</li>
<li>Collector - Summary records are sent to the collector</li>
</ul>
<p>NetFlow essentially creates metadata about data that travels through networks, but sometimes we need to analyze raw data.</p>
<p>We can do this using a <strong>protocol analyzer</strong> such as WireShark to gather network frames.</p>
<p>Network Performance Baseline - Shows what a typical day for a network might look like using various metrics</p>
<ul>
<li>Useful for troubleshooting for comparison</li>
<li>Often collected by SIEM or management console</li>
</ul>
<p>SIEM (Security and Information Event Manager)</p>
<ul>
<li>Logging of security events and info</li>
<li>Includes both raw logs and summaries/reports</li>
<li>Security alerts and real time information</li>
<li>Log aggregation + long-term storage</li>
</ul>
<p>Syslog - a standard for transferring log file from many different devices to a central location, oftentimes a SIEM</p>
<p>So data is being sent to the SIEM using syslog, but we quickly become overwhelmed with data. We can choose to only capture information of a certain priority or store certain longs for a shorter period of time than others.</p>
<p>API Integration -  Allows us to control and manage devices directly from a central management station, as well as automate these tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>No SSH required, essentially communication with devices in their &quot;native language&quot;</li>
<li>You can write scripts to automatically control or manage devices using APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>Port Mirroring - Allows you to copy traffic from one or more switch ports to a port mirror</p>
<ul>
<li>Can also mirror from one switch to another</li>
<li>Port mirror: AKA SPAN</li>
</ul>

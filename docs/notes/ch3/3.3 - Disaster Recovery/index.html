<p>Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) - Procedures for resuming operations after a disaster</p>
<ul>
<li>Backups</li>
<li>Off-site data replication</li>
<li>Cloud alternatives</li>
<li>Remote sites</li>
</ul>
<p>Third parties also provide disaster recovery services, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locations</li>
<li>Recovery Services</li>
</ul>
<p>Recover Time Objective (RTO) - Amount of time between when a system has an outage and when it goes back up</p>
<p>Recover Point Objective (RPO) - Amount of time between the last save point and the outage - reflects how much data was lost</p>
<p>MTTR - &quot;Mean time to repair&quot;</p>
<p>MTBF - &quot;Mean time before failure&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Useful in determining how many backup devices to buy</li>
</ul>
<p>Site Resiliency - The amount of uptime achieved throughout a disaster. A big factor is how quickly operations can be moved or resumed after a disaster.</p>
<p>Cold Site - An empty building. A blank slate. No hardware or people.</p>
<p>Hot Site - An &quot;exact&quot; replica of the main data center</p>
<p>Warm Site - Somewhere in the middle. Might have some or all hardware, racks, etc.</p>
<p>Tabletop Exercises - A simulated run through of a disaster drill, often done at a conference table.</p>
<p>Validation Tests - Actually testing your DRP in a realistic scenario</p>

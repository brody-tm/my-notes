Spanning Tree Protocol (**IEEE Standard 802.1D**) was made to prevent loops in switched networks

### STP Port States
- Blocking - not forwarding to prevent a loop
- Listening - not forwarding and cleaning the MAC table
- Learning - not forwarding and adding to the MAC table
- Forwarding - data passes through and is fully operational

**Ports**
- Root - Interface that is ultimately connected to the networkâ€™s single Root Bridge
- Designated - Any other port that is not directly connected to the Root but can forward traffic 
- Blocked - Ports that do not forward traffic

If an interface goes down, STP will reconfigure the ports on the network

### RSTP (802.1w)
*Rapid STP*

Faster convergence: 30-50s -> 6s
- Faster recovery from failure

Backwards comparable with 802.1D STP

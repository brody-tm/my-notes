**Job of the router** - forwarding traffic between 1 IP subnet and another

Identify destination IP from inside packet
- If its on a locally connected subnet, forward the packet to the local device
- If its on a remote subnet, forward to the next-hop router/gateway

The "map" of forwarding locations is the routing table - it tells a router where the next hop should be

**Static routing** - Administratively define the routes
- Quick way to configure a route and fine for small network
- Does not change or automatically update

**EIGRP** - A routing protocol partly proprietary to Cisco. Easy to setup and use.

**OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** 
*Used for routing traffic within an autonomous network*
- More generic and well-established
- Used **within** a network that an individual has complete of, known as a Single Autonomous System (AS)
- Interior gateway protocol (used within an AS)
- "Link-state protocol" - Routing is based on the connectivity between routers

**BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**
*Used for routing traffic outside of an autonomous network*
- Exterior gateway protocol (connect different autonomous systems)
- Commonly used on WAN and internet connections

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Allow or disallow traffic based on different factors, such as source and destination IP, port number, time of day, application, etc.

"Don't allow video streaming traffic from to 192.169.1.0 past 5 PM or on weekends"

**Firewall Security Policies** are a complex form of ACLs - allow for very specific and fine-grain security control

### Firewall Rules
Firewall rules follow a logical path, usually from top to bottom. Generally, more specific rules are at the top while more general rules are at the bottom

Example:

| Rule Number | Remote IP | Remote Port | Local Port | Protocol | Action |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| 1           | All       | Any         | 22         | TCP      | Allow  |
| 2           | All       |             |            | ICMP     | Deny   |

If traffic doesn't match any existing rule, it will automatically be denied. This is known as an **implicit deny**

### URL Filtering
Allow or restrict traffic based on Uniform Resource Location/Identifier (URI)

We can manage access to sites based on category, such as auction sites, travel sites, etc.

Often integrated into a NGFW

### Content Filtering
Software can monitor data being sent over a network for sensitive information and prevent that traffic from traversing the network

NSFW filters, parental controls, anti-virus, and anti-malware software provide a type of content filtering

### Screened Subnet
A separate area of your network that visitors can access over the internet, allowing for public access to public materials, such as web servers, while keeping private data inaccessible

### Security Zones
Zone-based security - more flexible and secure than IP address ranges

A network is separated into zones, for example, a trusted and untrusted zone

We can then make security policies that reference these zones, for example, if the trusted and untrusted zones are allowed to communicate

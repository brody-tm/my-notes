Remember that we can logically group together devices in a *VLAN*
- Organization, segmentation, security

Devices on their own VLAN are effectively on their own network

VLAN Hopping - when one VLAN communicates directly with another without passing through a router
- Not supposed to happen
- Done via 2 methods: switch spoofing and double tagging

VLAN Trunk - We can configure a *VLAN trunk* to connect multiple VLANs on the same switch to another switch with a single cable, rather than connecting each VLAN to the switch separately.

Switch Spoofing takes advantage of some switches' autoconfiguration process that designates each interface as either a device or a trunk. 
- An attacker pretends to be a switch to gain access to other VLANs via the trunk
- Turning off trunk negotiation and manually configuring trunks is recommended

Double Tagging
- VLAN tags - used in trunking between switches to show which VLAN the data is destined for
- Double tagging involves crafting a packet that includes multiple VLAN tags
- Double tagging exploits the *native VLAN* configuration - the first VLAN tag is removed by the first switch and the second is now visible
- Responses cannot be sent back to messages sent with double tagging
- To mitigate this, don't put any devices on the native VLAN

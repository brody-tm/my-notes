<p>DHCP Scope - The available IP address range as well as excluded addresses, subnet mask, lease durations, and other options.</p>
<p>DHCP Pools - Groupings of IP addresses (within scope)</p>
<ul>
<li>Each subnet has its own scope</li>
</ul>
<p>Addresses given by DHCP have a &quot;lease&quot; period for which they will remain assigned to a device</p>
<p>A DHCP server will keep track of which mac addresses used which IPs and will assign a device the same IP it used before</p>
<p>Address reservation - We can manually link a particular IP address to a MAC address so that the device will always get that IP</p>
<p>DHCP Leases essentially auto renew:</p>
<ul>
<li>The device will check in with the DHCP server at two times to try to renew its IP:
<ul>
<li>T1: Once 50% of the lease time is up</li>
<li>T2: Once 87.5% (7/8) of the lease time is up</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DHCP options - A special field in the DHCP message that includes many options</p>
<ul>
<li>256 (254 usable) options</li>
<li>0 is pad, 255 is end</li>
<li>Common options are subnet mask, DNS server, domain name, etc.</li>
<li>Option 129: Call Server IP address</li>
<li>Option 135: HTTP Proxy for phone-specific applications</li>
</ul>

BOOTP / Bootstrap - The 1993 precursor to DHCP

DHCP provides automatic IP address configuration and other configuration for most devices.

### DHCP Process
D - Discover - Requesting device sends a DHCP discover packet over broadcast
O - Offer - DHCP server sees discover packet and sends an offer over broadcast
R - Request - Requesting device picks an IP and sends a request for it over broadcast
A - Acknowledgement - DHCP server sends an acknowledgement 

In this process, the requesting device uses udp/68 and the DCHP server uses udp/67

Because broadcasts only happen within a subnet, DHCP does not work across subnets. Luckily, we have a way to do this: DHCP Relays

DHCP Relay - Forwards a discover packet to a subnet with a DHCP server

Gem - The subnet mask tells the device which IP address it can communicate with directly and which it needs to send to the local gateway IP.

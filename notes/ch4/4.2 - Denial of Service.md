Denial of Service (DoS) - Forcing a service to fail
- Overloading the service, exploiting a design failure or vulnerability
- Important to keep systems up to date
- Sometimes, a DoS is a distraction for another attack

Friendly DoS - When it's your fault

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) - when many devices are deployed to bring down a service
- Botnets with thousands or millions of servers
- Asymmetric threat - when the attack has fewer resources than the victim

DDoS Reflection and Amplification
- Attacker sends a small amount of traffic that is amplified by various systems and protocols
- NTP, DNS, and ICMP can be abused to amplify traffic

Botnet Command and Control (C&C) - device that manages the process of a DDoS attacker

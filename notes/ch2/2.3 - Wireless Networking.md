**Independent Basis Service Set (IBSS)**
- Two devices communicate directly using 802.11 with no access point
- This is an *ad hoc* connection, meaning it is created on the fly for a specific purpose, without an access point
- It is commonly used for IoT

Access Point Parameters
- SSID (Service Set Identifier) - The name of the wireless network
	- The same SSID may be used for multiple APs
- BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) - The hardware address of an access point

ESSID (Extended SSID) - The network name shared across access points
- Allows for a user to walk between different APs and stay connected

Captive Portal - The log-in screen that appears when first connecting to a wireless network

---
**Wireless Security Modes**
WPA/2/3-Personal / WPA/2/3-PSK
- WPA2 or WPA3 with a pre-shared key
- Everyone uses the same 256-bit key

WPA/2/3-Enterprise / WPA/2/3-802.1X
- Authenticates users individually with an authentication server (i.e. RADIUS, LDAP, etc)

OWE (Opportunistic Wireless Encryption)
- Allows a user to connect to the network without authentication, but prohibits it from communicating with other devices on the network

---
Omnidirectional Antenna
- One of the most common on APs
- Signal is evenly distributed on all sides

Directional Antenna
- Focuses signal in one direction
	- Increases range
- Examples: Yagi, Parabolic (single point)

**Managing Wireless Configurations**
Autonomous access points
- General purpose
- Switch is not wireless-aware

Lightweight access points
- Intelligence is in the switch
- Less Expensive
- Control and Provision
---
Control and Provision
- CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) - an RFC standard that allows for the management of multiple APs simultaneously

Wireless LAN Controller
- Centralized management of access points - A single "pane of glass"
- Allows for AP deployment, performance and security monitoring, batch configuration, reporting, etc.
- Usually a propriety system that is paired with the APs

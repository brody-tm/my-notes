<p><strong>Distribution Frame</strong> - Area where you passively terminate cables</p>
<ul>
<li>Punch down blocks / patch panels</li>
<li>Usually mounted on the wall or a flat surface</li>
<li>Supports all transport media (copper, fiber, voice, and data)</li>
<li>Often used as a room or location name (&quot;distribution frame room&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Main Distribution Frame (MDF)</strong> - The primary distribution frame and central point of a network, usually in a data center</p>
<ul>
<li>Termination point of WAN links - &quot;connects the inside to the outside&quot;</li>
<li>Good test point, test in both directions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF)</strong> - Extension of the MDF, a strategic distribution point</p>
<ul>
<li>Connects users to the network (uplink from MDF, switches and routers)</li>
<li>This combination is typically used in larger orgs with people in various locations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Equipment Racks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>19&quot; rack/device width</li>
<li>Height measured in rack units (&quot;U&quot;)
<ul>
<li>1U is 1.75&quot;</li>
<li>A common rack height is 42U</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Depth can vary, often determined by the equipment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cooling (HVAC)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data center aisles may be designated as &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; aisles to optimize cooling
<ul>
<li>Exhaust into hot aisle, intake from cold aisle</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cable Infrastructure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Goal is to not touch it again</li>
<li>Common Configuration - A wire run from each desk into a panel (110 block), on the other side of the panel is an RJ45 (ethernet port), from there the ethernet ports are connected to switches. This allows any desk to be connected to any switch without touching the underlying cabling.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Copper Patch Panel / Patch Bay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Punch-down block on one side, RJ45 connector on the other</li>
<li>Come out of RJ45 into a switch</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fiber Distribution Panel</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Permanent Fiber Installation</li>
<li>Patch panel at both ends</li>
<li>Basically, connect two locations with fiber</li>
<li>Fiber &quot;Bend Radius&quot; - can't bend the fiber too tight</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Locking Cabinets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data center hardware is usually managed by different groups, each responsible for that equipment</li>
<li>Racks can be installed together, side by side</li>
<li>Ventilation on front, back, top, and bottom</li>
</ul>

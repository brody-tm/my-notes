*Reminder:* MAC addresses are 48 bits / 6 bytes

The first half of a MAC address is called the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)
- the manufacturer

The latter half of a MAC address is called the Network Interface Controller-Specific
- the serial number
- "burned in address"

Table in the switch keeps track of MAC addresses and which interfaces they are associated with
- Entries in this table are typically cached and age out periodically

MAC address table creation
- All inbound MAC addresses are recorded if not already in the table
	- The interface over which the traffic was received is recorded as the "output interface"
- Any traffic of which the destination MAC is not know persists as "inbound" traffic

| Mac Address    | Output Interface |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1000:1111:1111 | F0/1             |
| 1000:2222:2222 | F0/2             |
| 1000:3333:4444 | F0/3             |

MAC addresses tables are *central* to the switching process

### Mac Flooding
The MAC address table begins to fill up as more devices send traffic over a switch. Once it does fill up, all traffic will be automatically forwarded to every interface on the switch.
- This allows an attacker to see all traffic being sent over a switch
- Modern switches' port security setting allow MAC flooding to be restricted

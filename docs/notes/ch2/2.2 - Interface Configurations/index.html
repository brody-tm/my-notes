<h3>Basic Interface Configuration</h3>
<p><strong>Speed</strong>: 10 / 100/ 1,000 Mb, 10 Gb
<strong>Duplex</strong>: Half / Full</p>
<ul>
<li>Both of these settings must match on the device and switch. Configuration can be done automatically or manually</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IP Address Management</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3>Link Aggregation (LAG)</h3>
<p>Also known as <em>port bonding</em></p>
<p>When multiple interfaces act like one big interface</p>
<p><strong>Scenario</strong>: You have two switches that need to communicate. Each interface offers 1 Gb ethernet. By setting up 4 connections between the switches using LAG, they act as a single 4Gb link.</p>
<p><strong>Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)</strong>
Automatically configure LAG</p>

<h3>Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)</h3>
<p>Defines the largest size of a data packet that can be transmitted across a network connection in a single transaction</p>
<p>Aims to reduce packet fragmentation, facilitating more efficient communication between devices</p>
<hr>
<h3>Jumbo Frames</h3>
<p>Ethernet frames with more than 1,500 bytes of payload (the default ethernet frame size).</p>
<p>Up to 9,216 bytes of an MTU (9,000 is the accepted norm)</p>
<p>Increase transfer efficiency (fewer packets to swicth/route)</p>

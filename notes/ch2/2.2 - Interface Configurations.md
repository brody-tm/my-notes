### Basic Interface Configuration
**Speed**: 10 / 100/ 1,000 Mb, 10 Gb
**Duplex**: Half / Full
- Both of these settings must match on the device and switch. Configuration can be done automatically or manually

**IP Address Management**

### Link Aggregation (LAG)
Also known as *port bonding*

When multiple interfaces act like one big interface

**Scenario**: You have two switches that need to communicate. Each interface offers 1 Gb ethernet. By setting up 4 connections between the switches using LAG, they act as a single 4Gb link.

**Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)**
Automatically configure LAG

### Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
Defines the largest size of a data packet that can be transmitted across a network connection in a single transaction

Aims to reduce packet fragmentation, facilitating more efficient communication between devices

---
### Jumbo Frames
Ethernet frames with more than 1,500 bytes of payload (the default ethernet frame size). 

Up to 9,216 bytes of an MTU (9,000 is the accepted norm)

Increase transfer efficiency (fewer packets to swicth/route)

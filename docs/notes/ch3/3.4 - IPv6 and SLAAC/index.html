<p>IPv6 devices can assign IP addresses to themselves.</p>
<p>This is known as &quot;Stateless Addressing&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>No dedicated DHCP server</li>
<li>No keeping track of IP or MAC addresses</li>
<li>No lease times</li>
</ul>
<p>The protocol is SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration)</p>
<ul>
<li>A device automatically configures an IP address for itself without a DHCP server</li>
</ul>
<p>DAD (Duplicate Address Detection) ensures that duplicate IPs are not used</p>
<p>NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) - Discover other devices on a network</p>
<ul>
<li>IPv4 uses ARP, which uses broadcast</li>
<li>NDP uses multicast</li>
</ul>
<p>NDP also allows us to discover routers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Router Solicitation (RS) - Multicast by a device to all IPv6 routers</li>
<li>Router Advertisement (RA) - Sent to a device in response to a solicitation OR multicast unsolicited</li>
</ul>
<p>How SLAAC Works</p>
<ol>
<li>Device determines what subnet it is on using RS through NDP</li>
<li>Router responds with an RA, device now knows the 64-bit subnet prefix
<ul>
<li>Remember, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Last 64 bits are often made from the device's MAC addresses with &quot;ff:fe&quot; in the middle or randomized</li>
<li>Before using the IP, DAD is used to check the network if that IP is being used</li>
</ol>

<p>Phishing - social engineering with a <em>bit</em> of spoofing - usually spoofing a sender name/email format</p>
<ul>
<li>You can usually spot fakes by viewing the email address</li>
</ul>
<p>Shoulder surfing - someone views sensitive information on a device from behind you or afar</p>
<p>Tailgating - Trailing an authorized user into a building against their knowledge</p>
<p>Piggybacking - When an authorized user knowingly helps you into a building</p>
<p>Sensitive information is often disposed of in dumpsters. This poses a security risk as dumpsters are typically unlocked and people dumpster dive</p>
<ul>
<li>In the US, dumpster diving is legal, assuming that it is on public property and no local code prohibits it</li>
</ul>

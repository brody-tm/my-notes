<p><strong>Job of the router</strong> - forwarding traffic between 1 IP subnet and another</p>
<p>Identify destination IP from inside packet</p>
<ul>
<li>If its on a locally connected subnet, forward the packet to the local device</li>
<li>If its on a remote subnet, forward to the next-hop router/gateway</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;map&quot; of forwarding locations is the routing table - it tells a router where the next hop should be</p>
<p><strong>Static routing</strong> - Administratively define the routes</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick way to configure a route and fine for small network</li>
<li>Does not change or automatically update</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EIGRP</strong> - A routing protocol partly proprietary to Cisco. Easy to setup and use.</p>
<p><strong>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)</strong>
<em>Used for routing traffic within an autonomous network</em></p>
<ul>
<li>More generic and well-established</li>
<li>Used <strong>within</strong> a network that an individual has complete of, known as a Single Autonomous System (AS)</li>
<li>Interior gateway protocol (used within an AS)</li>
<li>&quot;Link-state protocol&quot; - Routing is based on the connectivity between routers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)</strong>
<em>Used for routing traffic outside of an autonomous network</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Exterior gateway protocol (connect different autonomous systems)</li>
<li>Commonly used on WAN and internet connections</li>
</ul>

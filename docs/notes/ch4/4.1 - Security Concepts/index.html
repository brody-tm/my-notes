<p>Data is transit - Data transmitted over a network</p>
<p>Most network devices are concerned with forwarding data, not security</p>
<p>To secure a network, we use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Based Protection - firewalls, IPS</li>
<li>Transport Encryption - TLS, IPSec</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Data at rest - Data on a storage device</p>
<p>To protect data at rest, data is often encrypted before being stored</p>
<ul>
<li>Different parts of a device may be encrypted</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to encryption, permissions are also used in data storage</p>
<hr>
<p>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) - Manages digital certificates and keys for an organization</p>
<ul>
<li>Large project that requires lots of planning</li>
<li>Needed when an org deals with a lot of keys or issues a lot of certificates</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital Certificates - Given to users and devices, signed by a certificate authority</p>
<ul>
<li>Binds a public key with a digital signature from a CA</li>
<li>Web of Trust - If A trusts B and B trusts C, A trusts C</li>
<li>Creation of certificates is often built into OS, or can be done by a 3rd party</li>
</ul>
<p>Certificate Authority - The centralized authority that signs certificates</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be 3rd party or created by the organization</li>
<li>Lets us know that, for example, site can be trusted</li>
</ul>
<p>Self-signed Certificates</p>
<ul>
<li>A custom made CA for an organization. If the organization trusts it, I trust it</li>
</ul>
<p>IAM (Identity and Access Management)</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing users and other entities (ex. programs) access to data</li>
<li>Access control, authentication, authorization</li>
</ul>
<p>Least Privilege - A user can access only the bare minimum that is needed for their job</p>
<p>RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) - An admin creates roles, such as &quot;manager&quot; or &quot;shipping department&quot;, that have different levels of access then assigns these roles to users</p>
<p>Geographic Restrictions - Restriction based on location</p>
<ul>
<li>Can use IP, 802.11, or GPS (least to most accurate)</li>
<li>&quot;Geofencing&quot; - Adding or removing permissions based on a users location</li>
</ul>
<p>Camera - CCTV (Closed Circuit TV)</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern cameras often include motion or object detection</li>
<li>Many different cameras and networked together and recorded over time</li>
</ul>
<p>Door Locks</p>
<ul>
<li>Token-based access: RFID badge, magnetic swipe card, key fob</li>
<li>Biometric: Hand/finger print, retina</li>
<li>MFA - Example key fob + PIN</li>
</ul>

DHCP Scope - The available IP address range as well as excluded addresses, subnet mask, lease durations, and other options. 

DHCP Pools - Groupings of IP addresses (within scope)
- Each subnet has its own scope

Addresses given by DHCP have a "lease" period for which they will remain assigned to a device

A DHCP server will keep track of which mac addresses used which IPs and will assign a device the same IP it used before

Address reservation - We can manually link a particular IP address to a MAC address so that the device will always get that IP

DHCP Leases essentially auto renew:
- The device will check in with the DHCP server at two times to try to renew its IP:
	- T1: Once 50% of the lease time is up
	- T2: Once 87.5% (7/8) of the lease time is up

DHCP options - A special field in the DHCP message that includes many options
- 256 (254 usable) options
- 0 is pad, 255 is end
- Common options are subnet mask, DNS server, domain name, etc.
- Option 129: Call Server IP address
- Option 135: HTTP Proxy for phone-specific applications

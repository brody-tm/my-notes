Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) - Procedures for resuming operations after a disaster
- Backups
- Off-site data replication
- Cloud alternatives
- Remote sites

Third parties also provide disaster recovery services, including:
- Locations
- Recovery Services

Recover Time Objective (RTO) - Amount of time between when a system has an outage and when it goes back up

Recover Point Objective (RPO) - Amount of time between the last save point and the outage - reflects how much data was lost

MTTR - "Mean time to repair"

MTBF - "Mean time before failure"
-  Useful in determining how many backup devices to buy

Site Resiliency - The amount of uptime achieved throughout a disaster. A big factor is how quickly operations can be moved or resumed after a disaster.

Cold Site - An empty building. A blank slate. No hardware or people.

Hot Site - An "exact" replica of the main data center

Warm Site - Somewhere in the middle. Might have some or all hardware, racks, etc.

Tabletop Exercises - A simulated run through of a disaster drill, often done at a conference table.

Validation Tests - Actually testing your DRP in a realistic scenario

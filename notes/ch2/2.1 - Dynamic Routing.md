Routers handle the process of creating routes dynamically and update each other

All routers know where a knew route is added or one is removed

Router B may send an update to Router A with additional routes. Router A will update its routing table such that one of the new destinations in the update may now be reached by first sending packets to router B.

Different routing protocols use different criteria for determining the best route to take

### Methods for Securing a Wireless Network
- Authentication (username and password, MFA)
- Encrypt wireless traffic
- Verify integrity of communication
	- Message Integrity Check (MIC) - The received data should be identical to the original sent data
---
### Wireless Encryption Types
WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) - Deprecated and insecure legacy encryption type

WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) - The 2002 replacement for WEP
- Short-term bridge between WEP and the next successor that could run on existing hardware

WPA2 (2004) and CCMP
- CCMP block cipher mode - offered encryption and integrity in the same protocol
	- Encryption: AES
	- MIC: CBC-MAC

WPA3 (2018) and GCMP
- GCMP block cipher mode
- Encryption with AES again
- MIC with GMAC (Galois Message Authentication Code)

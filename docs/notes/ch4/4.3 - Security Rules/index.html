<h3>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</h3>
<p>Allow or disallow traffic based on different factors, such as source and destination IP, port number, time of day, application, etc.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't allow video streaming traffic from to 192.169.1.0 past 5 PM or on weekends&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Firewall Security Policies</strong> are a complex form of ACLs - allow for very specific and fine-grain security control</p>
<h3>Firewall Rules</h3>
<p>Firewall rules follow a logical path, usually from top to bottom. Generally, more specific rules are at the top while more general rules are at the bottom</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rule Number</th>
<th>Remote IP</th>
<th>Remote Port</th>
<th>Local Port</th>
<th>Protocol</th>
<th>Action</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>All</td>
<td>Any</td>
<td>22</td>
<td>TCP</td>
<td>Allow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>All</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>ICMP</td>
<td>Deny</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If traffic doesn't match any existing rule, it will automatically be denied. This is known as an <strong>implicit deny</strong></p>
<h3>URL Filtering</h3>
<p>Allow or restrict traffic based on Uniform Resource Location/Identifier (URI)</p>
<p>We can manage access to sites based on category, such as auction sites, travel sites, etc.</p>
<p>Often integrated into a NGFW</p>
<h3>Content Filtering</h3>
<p>Software can monitor data being sent over a network for sensitive information and prevent that traffic from traversing the network</p>
<p>NSFW filters, parental controls, anti-virus, and anti-malware software provide a type of content filtering</p>
<h3>Screened Subnet</h3>
<p>A separate area of your network that visitors can access over the internet, allowing for public access to public materials, such as web servers, while keeping private data inaccessible</p>
<h3>Security Zones</h3>
<p>Zone-based security - more flexible and secure than IP address ranges</p>
<p>A network is separated into zones, for example, a trusted and untrusted zone</p>
<p>We can then make security policies that reference these zones, for example, if the trusted and untrusted zones are allowed to communicate</p>

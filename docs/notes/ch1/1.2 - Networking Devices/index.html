<h3>Router</h3>
<p><em>Routes traffic between IP subnets</em></p>
<p>Routers are OSI Layer 3 (Network Layer) devices. They connect many different network types (LAN, WAN, copper, fiber).</p>
<h3>Switch</h3>
<p>Switches are OSI Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) devices. They forward traffic based on data link addresses.</p>
<h3>Firewall</h3>
<p><strong>Traditional</strong>: Filter traffic based on TCP or UDP port numbers.</p>
<p><strong>NGFW</strong>: Identify applications traversing a network and manage if they may be allowed on the network.</p>
<p>They can encrypt traffic and have routing functionality.</p>
<h3>IDS and IPS</h3>
<p><em>Intrusion Detection/Prevention System</em></p>
<p>Monitor network traffic for exploits and detects or blocks them.</p>
<h3>Load Balancers</h3>
<p>Distribute the load between multiple servers, invisible to end users. Provide fault tolerance and redundancy.</p>
<h3>Proxies</h3>
<p>Sits between the user and the internet and performs communication on the user's behalf. Does caching, access control, URL filtering, and content scanning.</p>
<h3>NAS and SAN</h3>
<p><strong>Network Attached Storage (NAS)</strong>
A storage device shared across a network. Provides file-level access (need to read and write entire files).</p>
<p><strong>Storage Area Network (SAN)</strong>
Operates like a local storage device. More efficient because it provides block-level access to files, so that only certain blocks of files need to be updated</p>
<h3>Access Points</h3>
<p>OSI Layer 2 device that acts as a bridge, extending a wired network onto a wireless network .</p>
<p>Performs translation between an 802.11 wireless network and an 802.3 ethernet network.</p>
<h3>Wireless LAN Controllers</h3>
<p>Provides centralized management of access points. Facilitates simple deployment of new access points and performance and security monitoring.</p>

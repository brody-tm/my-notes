### Networking with IPv4
**IP Address** - 32-bit / 4-byte unique identifier for every device on a network
- e.g. 192.168.1.165

**Subnet Mask** - used by the local device to determine what subnet it's on
- e.g. **255.255.255.0**
- Means **first 3 octets are the network address and last octet is the host address**
- Used by local device to determine what subnet it's on

**Default Gateway** - router that allows you to communication outside of your local subnet
- e.g. 192.168.1.1
- Must be an IP address on the local subnet
### Special IPv4 Addresses
**Loopback Address** - An address to yourself
- Ranges from 127.0.0.1 through 127.255.255.254
- Easy way to self-reference (ping 127.0.0.1) to confirm that your local IP stack is working properly

**Reserved Addresses** - Addresses set aside for future use or testing
- Ranges from 240.0.0.1 through 254.255.255.254
- "Class E" addresses

**Virtual IP Addresses (VIP)** - Addresses snot associated with a physical network adapter
- Virtual machines, internal router address

<p>Segmentation can be done physically, logically, or virtually</p>
<ul>
<li>Devices, VLANs, virtual networks</li>
</ul>
<p>Segmentation is done for various reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance - high bandwidth apps</li>
<li>Security - users should not talk to database servers</li>
<li>Compliance - payment card industry compliance, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>IoT devices may not have advanced security features, so they should be put on a separate network</p>
<p>IIoT (Industrial IoT) devices also should be segmented) to prevent disruptions from other traffic, as they are often in critical applications (medical, manufacturing</p>
<p>SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System) and ICS (Industrial Control Systems) are used to control equipment used in power generation, manufacturing, and more</p>
<ul>
<li>They often involve real time information and critical systems control</li>
<li><strong>SCADA and ICS are heavily segmented</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Operational Technology (OT)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware and software for electrical grids, traffic lights, sewage plant, etc.</li>
<li>Results of failure are wide reaching, segmentation critical</li>
</ul>
<p>Guest networks - allow guests to use your router to access the internet but not any of the devices on the network</p>
<p>BYOD - Bring your own device</p>
<ul>
<li>Device is segmented - separate area on your device created for company data</li>
</ul>

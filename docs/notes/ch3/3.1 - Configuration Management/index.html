<p>Things change in a network: new operating systems, patches, updates, network modifications, applications, etc.</p>
<p>We want to identify and document hardware and software settings</p>
<p>&quot;Production Configuration&quot;: Most current working configuration for a device</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware devices, firmware versions</li>
<li>Driver and app versions</li>
<li>Usually tested before installation</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Backup Configuration&quot;: A config we can roll back to if a new configuration doesn't work</p>
<ul>
<li>A backup should be made before any changes</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Golden/Baseline Configuration&quot;: Includes everything required for a new application instance to run</p>
<ul>
<li>OS configuration, firewall settings, the application itself</li>
<li>Certifies that the application will work if all these things are done</li>
<li>Integrity checks ensure that an instance is operating near the baseline</li>
</ul>
